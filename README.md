# Credit Card Validation Automation

## Description
This project automates the process of validating credit card numbers. Unlike manual checks done with pencil and paper, 
this solution leverages functions and loops to efficiently handle and verify multiple credit cards at a time. As a result, 
clerks can quickly process a larger batch of cards, allowing them to spend more time on other tasks or relaxing.

## Features
- Validates credit card numbers using a reliable algorithm (e.g., Luhn Algorithm).
- Handles multiple credit card numbers in one go.
- Optimizes the manual verification process.
- Easy to modify or expand for additional functionality.
